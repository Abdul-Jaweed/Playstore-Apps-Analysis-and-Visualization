 ## About the project

In this project, you will be working on a real-world dataset of the google play store, one of the most used applications for downloading android apps. This project aims on cleaning the dataset, analyze the given dataset, and mining informational quality insights. This project also involves visualizing the data to better and easily understand trends and different categories.

## Project Description

This project will help you understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using python for a better upcoming performance, how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database, and visualize the data with the power bi tool.

# Module 1: Pre-processing, Analyzing data using Python and SQL.

In this module, you will query the dataset using structured query language to gain insights from the database. The problem statements to be solved will be provided to you and you need to provide the solution for the same using your logic. Different concepts of SQL will be used in this process such as aggregating the data, grouping the data, ordering the data, etc. Module 1 consists of subtasks which are as follows

# Module 2: Visualization data using Tableau.

In this module, you will be using both datasets for visualizing what the
numbers in and behind the data want to convey. You have to create a
dashboard for the same using different statistical graphs and diagrams
for a visual understanding and analysis. Given below are the
requirements, create a dashboard consisting of mentioned visuals.
